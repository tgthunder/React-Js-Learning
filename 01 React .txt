React -> js library for bulding user interface. The page renders without reloading the entire page
2 ways of Creating React project -> Using Create react app npx (bundler but too bulkier)
Using vite/ parcel (lite version but so useful)

*** Package.jason - it contains dependecies , scripts and lot of information..
**** react simplifies the proccess of redering html with js. 
- we can build application on single page..
How does React Works in vite->
- look inside index.html you will have a div tag associated with id root and using that root a <App/> means a component 
rederend on that html via jsx file.
- The jsx file is added inside index.html using script tag.
- You dont need to add script inside index.html when you create react using create react app(core react)
- If you are creating react apps with vite you need to create components using jsx file .Write function 
name with initial letter in upper case


*** Understanding the under the hood of react and creating our own React..
- How can we create our own react -> at the end react is what a simple html in which js is injected..
- create a simple html file with a div #root and add a js script inside that..
- now create a html element like if we want to create a link means anchor tag. now behind the scence what react do 
It stores data of that html element inside a object and create a function which add that element to the root using document.appendChild
Thats it. 
- It performs multiple optimization and return you a html

** Now if you want to add variable inside html you can make use of {}
- You can not return enitre expressions like if else for loop inside {}. Only the final outcome of expression should be returned.

How react parse the html code and convert into object 
it uses React.createElement and takes few parameters in a sequence
1. type of html element 'a' ,'div','p','h1'
2. properties -> attributes and values inside an object
3. Direct text that you want to write inside element
4. js variables
This object is then passed to an optimized function and the function will add your html element to #root
-- babble which is a transpiler injects these html elements by parsing them.
