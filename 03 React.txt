Virtual Dom , Fibre , reconcilation
React has its own dom structure which compared with browser dom 
And only updates the required part rather than updating the entire 
Dom.
React uses Fibre algorithm to create virtual Dom
Actually when multiple updates occur at same time then rather than 
updating them individually update them all at once for this Fibre 
has pause , and many more methods.. Fibre sets priority that which
part will update first

Reconcilation -> algorithm which compares virtual Dom And browser Dom
