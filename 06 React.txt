Custom hooks and Components ->
- We can craeate our own custom hooks to perform specific task
- we can make use of react hooks to build custom hooks.
- Note : when you are using loops in react Html then make sure that you are accessing elements in arrays
with the help of keys (generally index in array when you apply map function)

- Note: make a seperate js file export all the components inside it and import the js file while redering
so that only one file should be imported basically to keep everything clean

** useId hook -> This hook generates unique id for accessibility attributes of html
you can bind input filed and label.
